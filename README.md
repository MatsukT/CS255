System Analysis and Design

The goal of this project was to collaborate with a client on the DriverPass program implementation. The task was to design a system that provides driving students with access to online courses, practice exams, and on-the-road training. 
The system was developed to include a Learning Management System for the online learning component and a scheduling feature that allows students to book driving sessions either online or through the DriverPass secretary by phone or in person.

Throughout the project, I also implemented secure user authentication and role-based access control, giving the Owner full management of accounts and the IT Officer responsibility for maintaining the system. 
Additionally, the system was designed to integrate automatically with local DMVs to receive updates on regulations, course materials, and test content.

One area I felt confident in was my Business Requirements Document (BRD). I clearly defined the project’s purpose and background while outlining both the functional and non-functional requirements in detail. I
f I were to improve one area, it would be my diagram work—I struggled with visualizing the step-by-step processes clearly, and with more time, I would refine it to make it easier to understand and more organized for viewers.

During this project, I focused on accurately interpreting and implementing the client’s needs by reviewing the DriverPass interview and ensuring every requested feature was incorporated into the system design. 
Understanding the user’s perspective is essential, as the success of any system depends on how well it meets the client’s goals and addresses their challenges.

This experience emphasized the importance of thorough requirement gathering as the foundation for successful system design. 
Having a clear understanding of what the system needs to accomplish provides direction and structure, making both the design and development phases far more efficient and effective. 
In future projects, I plan to continue using structured analysis, user feedback, and visual modeling techniques to strengthen communication and ensure that the final product aligns with user expectations.
