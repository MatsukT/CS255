System Analysis and Design

The goal of this project was to collaborate with a client for a DriverPass program implementation. The task at hand was to design a system that gives driving students access to online courses, practice exams, amd on the road training. 
The system was built to include a Learning Management System (LMS) for online learning and a scheduling feature that allows students to book driving sessions either online or through the DriverPass secretary by phone or in person. 
Throughout this project i also incorporated secure user authentication, role-based access (with the Owner managing all accounts and the IT Officer maintaining the system). 
Additionally automatic integration with local DMVs to receive updates on regulations, course material, and test content were included as well.

One area I felt confident in was my Business Requirements Documents.
I clearly defined the project’s purpose and background while detailing both functional and non-functional system requirements.
If I were to improve something, it would be a more refined diagram i struggled with visualizing the step by step processes to make it clear and less confusing to the viewer.

Throughout this project, I focused on interpreting and implementing the client’s needs by carefully reviewing the DriverPass interview and ensuring all requested features were included in the system design.
Understanding the user’s perspective is crucial since the true measure of a system’s success lies in how well it meets their expectations and solves their problems.

This experience reinforced the importance of thorough requirement gathering as the foundation for any successful system. 
Having a clear understanding of what the system needs to achieve provides direction and clarity, making the design and development phases far more efficient and effective.
